## Troubleshooting

### Gateway Won't Launch

**Problem**: Clicking "Open Designer" does nothing

**Solutions**:
- Verify Ignition Designer 8.3+ is installed
- Check that the `designer://` protocol is registered with your OS
- Try launching Ignition Designer manually first, then try again
- Verify the gateway URL is correct (must include `http://` or `https://`)

### Missing Gateway Data

**Problem**: Gateways disappear after closing the app

**Solutions**:
- **Desktop App**: Check that the app has permission to write to user data directory
- **Web Browser**: Ensure cookies/localStorage are enabled for the site
- Check browser privacy settings (private browsing may clear data on exit)

### Import Not Working

**Problem**: Can't import Ignition launcher JSON files

**Solutions**:
- Ensure the file is valid JSON (open in text editor to verify)
- Check that the file contains the expected Ignition launcher format
- Try importing one gateway at a time instead of batch import
- If all else fails, manually add the gateway using "Add Designer"

### Layout Issues

**Problem**: Cards or folders look wrong

**Solutions**:
- Try switching between Grid and List view
- Toggle grouping off and back on
- Refresh the application
- Resize the window if in desktop app

### Can't Reorder Items

**Problem**: Drag and drop doesn't work

**Solutions**:
- Make sure you're not in "Edit Folders" mode when trying to reorder gateways
- Try clicking and holding before dragging
- Check that grouping is enabled (grouping required for folder operations)
